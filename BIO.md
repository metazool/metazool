Jo Walsh is a programmer and researcher who is currently helping establish a new Research Software Engineering group at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.

Their industry career has covered natural language processing and semantic web work for the British Geological Survey, building open source GIS applications in both startups
and the public sector, and managing services and projects for text mining and geocoding in a research datacentre. 

In the mid 2000s, Jo was an active contributor to the Open Data movement. Alongside founding board memberships of the Open Knowledge Foundation
and the Open Source Geospatial Foundation, Jo was one of the original contributors to OpenStreetmap, a co-author of "Mapping Hacks", 2005, and a contributor to several web standards for
geographic information exchange.

Jo's interest in open geographic data and open source GIS emerged from her practise as a software artist and participation in the Locative Media art movement of the early 2000s. Their collaborative project with Andrew Paterson on "Locative Packets" in Karosta, Liepaja set the scene for a 20 year cycle of work.
